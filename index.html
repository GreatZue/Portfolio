        <p class="aboutMeText">I've been coding for about 3 years, and I feel it has always been a good fit for me.  I naturally reflect a lot, and with coding there's lots of opportunities to think about what works, what didn't, and what can be improved upon.  In my journey, I have figured out there is no better teacher than failure.  I am not someone who afraid to be vulnerable, put myself out there, and learn.
            
            </br></br>I also very much enjoy the comradery, and coming together with others to overcome a problem.  It's really motivating to me to want to push myself to learn things to help the team, or to teach someone!  Coding pushes me to become my best self, and thats something I hope to give back to others.

        </br></br>In 2019 I enrolled in a 3 month Full Stack Web Development class at a coding bootcamp called <a class="link" href="https://boisecodeworks.com/">Boise Codeworks</a>.  During my time here, I worked with a variety of individuals in person, and got a hands on experience what it's like to work on a team, and with deadlines.  I'm familiar with workplace tactics like agile development, and scrum methodology.  I feel I could flourish in such a collaborative environment versus the solitary one I hold currently.  Right now I work as a mover, and can't wait to find a job in web development, and give my body a break!</p>
