            <p>I've been coding for about 3 years, and I feel it has always been a good fit for me.  I naturally reflect a lot, and with coding there's lots of opportunities to think about what works, what didn't, and what can be improved upon.  In my journey, I have figured out there is no better teacher than failure.  I am not someone who afraid to be vulnerable, put myself out there, and learn.
            
            </br></br>I also very much enjoy the comradery, and coming together with others to overcome a problem.  It's really motivating to me to want to push myself to learn things to help the team, or to teach someone!  Coding pushes me to become my best self, and thats something I hope to give back to others.
